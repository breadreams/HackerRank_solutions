/**
  * MinAvgTwoSlice
  *
  * Find the minimal average of any slice containing at least two elements.
  *
  * A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given.
  * A pair of integers (P, Q), such that 0 ≤ P < Q < N, is called a slice of array A (notice that the slice contains at least two elements). The average of a slice (P, Q) is the sum of A[P] + A[P + 1] + ... + A[Q] divided by the length of the slice.
  * To be precise, the average equals (A[P] + A[P + 1] + ... + A[Q]) / (Q − P + 1).
